RaptorQ codes are a powerful form of Forward Error Correction. They allow data to be reconstructed even when packets are lost during transmission. This is crucial for unreliable networks like satellite links or mobile connections. The encoder generates a set of source symbols from the original data. Then, it can create a potentially limitless stream of repair symbols. The decoder only needs to receive a sufficient number of *any* symbols. The total number required is just slightly more than the original number of source symbols. This flexibility is what makes RaptorQ so efficient. It avoids the need for re-transmissions, saving bandwidth and time. Our
